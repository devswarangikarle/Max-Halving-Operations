# Max-Halving-Operations

In a math challenge, Mia is presented with N integers written on a board. She can perform a special operation only if all the integers are even. The operation allows her to pick any integer, say x, and replace it with x/2. Mia wants to see how many times she can perform this operation before at least one of the numbers becomes odd. Whatâ€™s the maximum number of operations Mia can carry out?

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int num = arr[i];
            if (num % 2 != 0) {
                System.out.println(0);
                return;
            }
            while ((num / 2) % 2 == 0) {
                res++;
                num /= 2;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(res);
    }
}
